# remove-line-range-from-files

```

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   This script is designed to remove a range of lines from files, while protecting symlinks, user/group file
     permissions and avoiding file locking which causes the files to be write protected during processing.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Example: script.sh --follow-symlinks --verbose --start-line 11 --end-line 20 --filepath "/var/log/app/*.log"
      Example: script.sh -lv -s 11 -e 20 -f "/var/log/app/*.log"

      Required options:
      -s, --start-line           Define the initial line number within the range to remove.
      -e, --end-line             Define the final line number within the range to remove.
      -f, --filepath             Define the full filepath of the files to remove the line range from.

      Optional options:
      -l, --follow-symlinks      Include symlinks when replacing a range of lines.
      -m, --max-depth            Maximum amount of directory levels to decend while scanning for files (default: 0).
      -v, --verbose              Prints the files that are being modified as the program processes.
      -h, --help                 Display help options for this script to function correctly.

      Hint: When testing this script, you can output the contents of a file with line numbers.

      Example: cat test.txt  | awk '{print "Line "NR ": " $0}'

```

You can use "sed", but you have to make the changes to a temporary file and use "cp" to overwrite the original, avoiding issues with symlinks and permissions.


Alternatively, you can just automate the "vi" text editor to do it. 

This retains symlinks and user/group and file permissions, whilst avoiding file locking and causing the file to be write protected during processing.

vi +<Start line to remove>,<End line to remove>d +wq <file>

For instance:

vi +13,26d +wq my.log

Which would remove lines 13-26 (including 13 and 26) from the file "my.log".

Unfortunately, this did not work properly with multiple files or wildcard patterns.

For instance:
vi +13,26d +wq my* - Would not find my.log and only the files "my*" without a filename extension ".xxx".


So a better way would be to use the "find" package to find the files first and execute the command for each one.

find -L my* ! -type d -execdir vi +13,26d +wq "{}" \;

This method will allow for wildcard patterns and with the "-L" argument, will also follow symlinks.
